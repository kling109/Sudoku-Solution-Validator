Sudoku Solution Validator Design Document

3 March 2019

Overview:

This document provides a framework for the development of a Sudoku puzzle validator.  The program takes an input of a formatted
text file, and outputs a set of reccomendations to fix the given grid.   The file should be formatted in a grid, with entries in
each row separated by commas.  The program then will read in the file, evaluate the grid for errors, and output a list of actions
to take in order to fix any issues in the grid.

Goals:

Allow an N-by-N grid of arbitrary N characters to be checked for correctness, based on Sudoku rules.
Apply multithreading to improve computation speed.

Milestones:
3 March 2019 - Complete SDD

Proposed Solution:

Class: SudokuValidator
  - private variables:
     vector<string> solutionList:
       Contains a list of changes to make to fix the errors in the input file
       
     vector<vector<int> > errorList:
       Each element of the list contains 3 parameters; the row, the column, and a duplicate character
       
     int** gameBoard:
       Contains the sudoku grid, taken in from the input specifications.
       
     pthread_mutex_t lock:
       Standard mutex lock for multithreading access to the error list.
       
  - public variables:
      N/A
  - private methods:
      void checkRows():
        Finds errors in a particular row.  Consists of looping from 0 to N-1 and calling findRowError(i) on the specific row 
        number.
        
      void findRowError(int i):
        Iterates over gameBoard[i], adding each unique character it comes across to a vector.  If a character is encountered
        twice, the set of row-column-element is added to the error list if it is new.
        
      Methods for checkColumn, findColumnError, checkBlock, and findBlockError should follow identically.
      
      void toFix()
        Each error is then checked for the row, column, and block.  The block solution is replaced, then
        findRowError and findColumnError are called on the given row and column.  IThe initial error is removed
        from the errorList and a string indicating what to replace the error element with is added to the solutionList.
        If the errorList is not empty, toFix is called recursively.

  - public methods:
    void readFile(string fileName):
      Reads in a file, parsing it to a two-dimensional array assigned to "gameBoard".
      
    void fixBoard():
      Having read in a gameBoard, the program proceeds to reccomend methods to fix the board.  This is the main function of 
      the class, and will largely be calling other methods.  Th class will instantiate three threads; one to check for errors
      in the format of rows, one to check columns, and one to check blocks.  All of these threads will write their errors to 
      the "errorList."  The process of fixing errors is then given to a helper method toFix.  Once toFix finishes, the set of
      solutions in order of application is printed to the command line.
      
Open Questions:
Is there an optimal way to check for how to solve a given error without disrupting the rest of the grid?
